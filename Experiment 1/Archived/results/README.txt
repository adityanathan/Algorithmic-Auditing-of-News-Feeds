This is a collection of scripts and code that I used to plot the graphs for my report.
I haven't written documentation for this because this is just generic matplotlib and pickle.
You're free to use any other way to do the same. 
All the data necessary is stored in the pickle files generated from python files like hdp_exp1.py, etc.
