# Algorithmic-Auditing-of-News-Feeds
This is a respository of code written for a project done under Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth at ACT4D Lab @ IIT-D

### Instructions to Lab Members of ICTD for reproducing code:
* To generate initial data, run db_extract.ipynb first and then preprocess.py.
* To run experiment 3,
    * Execute extract_text&index.ipynb
    * Execute exp3_main.ipynb
    * You may visualize output files from previous step yourself or you may take hints from plot_data.ipynb.
    * You can see some sample plots in the "Sample Plots" folder.
* To run Experiment 4,
    * Execute Box_plots.ipynb
    * Some sample outputs have been provided in the "Sample Outputs" folder

### Notes:
* Ignore all files in archived folders.
* Some degree of proficiency in the gensim library is encouraged before attempting to read this code
* You are advised to read the code and understand it so that you may tweak the parameters and experiment with them. (There are a lot of parameters involved)
